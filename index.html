            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                  I love to spend my free time cooking, gardening, coding, reading on mycology and mushroom hunts, working out, gaming, fishing, or anything else that might pique my interest! 
                  I worked as a refrigeration analyst for a fortune one hundred company for 6 years. Covid had different plans and I found myself on the career hunt unexpectedly with a child on the way. I started a small business called The Sticka Emporium which is still in operation since mid-2020. I had to sell my home and had a rare opportunity to pursue a lifelong I.T. interest as a career. I acquired funding and enrolled in DevCodeCamps full time, three month long Full Stack Programming camp!

                          <p><strong><u>Language</u>:</strong> Python</p>
                          <p><strong><u>Purpose</u>:</strong> Build a program in Python using Visual Studio Code that could have a Herd of three Dinosaurs with Attack Power attributes and a Fleet of three Robots with an importable weapon. Health of individual units was tracked during each turn, and players unit eliminated when health reached zero. Team wins when other team runs out of units. Game will properly display winner and end game.</p>

                          <p><strong><u>Language</u>:</strong> Python</p>
                          <p><strong><u>Purpose</u>:</strong> Build a program in Python using Visual Studio Code that allowed a user to randomly generate a trip from user input to different locations. Each selection would then loop into a set of four selections per set. Each set had five sub selections. You could reselect at any point and start over if desired. Program would display completed trip and allow user input to print trip or start over.</p>

                          <p><strong><u>Purpose</u>:</strong> Build a program in Python using Visual Studio Code that allowed for Human vs Human or Human vs Ai. Rules were first player to two wins. You had a total of five selections and each selection would beat two of the five selections only. Game tracked wins and would auto select if Ai was opponent. Game would end battle loop and display winner once the win parameters were met. </p>
